GROMACS:      gmx mdrun, version 2019.4
Executable:   /sw/csi/gromacs/2019/el7.6_openmpi2.1.1_intel2018-sp/executables/bin/gmx_mpi
Data prefix:  /sw/csi/gromacs/2019/el7.6_openmpi2.1.1_intel2018-sp/executables
Working dir:  /ibex/scratch/ismailiy/reframe/ismailiy_reframe/ksl_postmaint_tests/stage/ibex/batch/intel/gromacs_check
Command line:
  gmx_mpi mdrun -deffnm md_0_1

Compiled SIMD: SSE4.1, but for this host/run AVX_512 might be better (see
log).
The current CPU can measure timings more accurately than the code in
gmx mdrun was configured to use. This might affect your simulation
speed as accurate timings are needed for load-balancing.
Please consider rebuilding gmx mdrun with the GMX_USE_RDTSCP=ON CMake option.
Reading file md_0_1.tpr, VERSION 2019.4 (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 10 to 50, rlist from 1 to 1.116


Using 8 MPI processes
Using 1 OpenMP thread per MPI process


Non-default thread affinity set probably by the OpenMP library,
disabling internal thread affinity
starting mdrun 'LYSOZYME in water'
50000 steps,    100.0 ps.

Writing final coordinates.


Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB was turned on during the run due to measured imbalance.
 Average load imbalance: 1.2%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 78%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 0.9%.
 Steps where the load balancing was limited by -rdd, -rcon and/or -dds: X 0 % Y 0 %
